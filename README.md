# DRAGN-Server-Test
Python console application to test DRAGN-Server


## Setup
Run DRAGN-Server on your local machine and make note of the IP address and port number it is running on.

Before running servertest.py, you must update the ip and port values in class Console __init__() to match those given from 
DRAGN-Server. 

## Run instructions
When the test client is running, it will ask for the index of a chatbot to connect to. Chatbots indices are printed upon startup but
can be viewed again by typing -h or --help. Input should be a single integer value.

When you are done, quit the test client by typing --quit, quit, or q in the input.
